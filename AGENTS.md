# Project Rules

1. Plan before implementation.
2. Test what you are implementing.
3. Review architecture if it makes sense.
4. Review README or create it / update it once you implemented sth new.
5. Verify building scripts that are working after all changes.
6. Check all buttons and flows that they are working - in tests.
7. If repo is initialized ask if i want to commit changes. If i say yes do that with proper message what was done in the commit.
